   ## Description


    For my final project, I created a MERN stack site that allows users to input ingredients to generate recipes, which I used the Spoonacular API for.

    This application was made after Thanksgiving, and so everyone was thinking about leftovers and how to use them. Given how people usually don't have a fixed amount of leftovers in there fridge, I left the parameters rather open ended.

    Parameters:
    A comma separated list of ingredients 
    
    Output:
    The first three recipes, the ingredients missing for each recipe, and a button to view a more detailed recipe card
